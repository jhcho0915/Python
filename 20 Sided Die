#This program simulates and outputs the 
#result of 100 rolls of a fair 20-sided die with 
#an estimate for the average of those roles 
#(including the standard deviation of that estimated 
#average) and an estimate for the expected value 
#of a single roll of a 20-sided die (including the 
#standard deviation of that expected value).

#values is the list that has the values of all the roles

  #generating a random number between 1 and 20 inclusive...simulates die roll
  random_number = random.randint(1,20)
  values.append(random_number)
  print("Number on Die", random_number)

#the probability for each value is probability
